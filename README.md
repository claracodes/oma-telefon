[![wirvsvirushackathon](app/assets/images/Logo_Projekt_01.png "#wirvsvirus Hackathon")](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/)

A project of the [WirVsVirus Hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/).

Corony is a platform that connects people without internet with volunteers that are willing to help society in these crazy times.
It is built using the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/) and Ruby On Rails.

People who seek for help can call an automated hotline and describe their problem. Then a volunteer can visit http://www.corony.club/ and see what he can do to help!
